Description: I created the undo button, and the variable storing button. The Red Variable button stores the display value as the value for the key called “Var” in the dictionary. When you press the green Var button, it retrieves the value of the key “Var”. This means there can only be one variable stored at a time, which is not quite right, but I did not know based on the instructions how I was supposed to come up with different keys every time you “set a variable”.  The arrow on the bottom right corner is the undo button and will undo any number if the user is in the middle of typing, otherwise it will undo the last thing done. It does not affect the storing of variable values. The clear button has two functions: one for when it is pressed once, and another function for when it is pressed twice.
