Description: I made four main functions the view controller, one for digits, one for the unary/binary/constant/equals functions, one for the decimal point, and one for the memoryOperations. They all called functions inside the model, and the model changed the value of accumulator.I used a switch case for the memory operations, and I did not use a stack for the clear function, because the math operations did not use a stack either and so I did not think I needed one.
